I will try to use the mathematical operations in this md file
first let's try multiplicatio:

## Multiplication

$n = p \times q$ ; $p$ and $q$ are primes

$$\phi(n) = \phi(p) \times \phi(q) = (p-1) \times (q-1)$$

Let's take $p=4$ and $q=6$. They share a factor (2), so they are not coprime. Total $n = 24$.

Find unique primes of 24: $24 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3$. The unique primes are just 2 and 3.

Apply Formula: $$ \phi(24) = 24 \times (1 - \frac{1}{2}) \times (1 - \frac{1}{3}) $$ $$ \phi(24) = 24 \times (0.5) \times (\frac{2}{3}) $$ $$ \phi(24) = 12 \times \frac{2}{3} = 8 $$
